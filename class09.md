# Functional Programming in Javascript

**Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data**

## pure functions

**it uses a global object that was not passed as a parameter to the function.**

## Benefits Of pure functions

**The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts**

* **It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)**
* **It does not cause any observable side effects**

## Immutability

**Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.**

## module

**A module is a software component or part of a program that contains one or more routines. One or more independently developed modules make up a program. An enterprise-level software application may contain several different modules, and each module serves unique and separate business operations.**

**Modules make a programmer's job easy by allowing the programmer to focus on only one area of the functionality of the software application. Modules are typically incorporated into the program (software) through interfaces.**

## require in node js

**The basic functionality of require is that it reads a JavaScript file, executes the file, and then proceeds to return the exports object.**

## How do I import a module from another module?

**To import a module from another path, you first need to import the sys module as well as any other Python modules that you would like to use in your program. The sys module is provided by the Python Standard Library and it provides functions and parameters that are system-specific**
