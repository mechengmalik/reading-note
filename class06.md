 _Node.js is an event-driven JavaScript runtime. Node has myriad potential uses for JavaScript development including being a great environment for building efficient network applications._

## what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

**V8 is `Google’s open source` high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js**

## What is npm?

**`npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform`. It puts modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency conflicts intelligently. It is extremely configurable to support a wide variety of use cases. Most commonly, it is used to publish, discover, install, and develop node programs.**

### How does pair programming work?

_pair programming commonly involves two roles: the **Driver** and the **Navigator**._

* **Driver**
**the Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code**


* **Navigator**
**he Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.**
